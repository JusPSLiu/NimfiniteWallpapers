# Nimfinite Wallpapers
by the Nimfinite Nimwits

Using the Nim programming language, this program automates changing the Windows desktop background using the wNim and winim libraries.

To run, install Nim 1.4.8 and compile.

Keep all the folders relative to one another

Everything shown in the GUI should work beyond this point.

# Creating a Custom Slideshow
The program supports the functionality of creating your own custom slideshow. Simply load your desired images, set each image length, and then play it back with the play button at the bottom of the program.

Slides can be reordered with the `Swap with Next` and `Swap with Previous` buttons, and an image can be replaced with the `Replace Image` button.

In order to set the length, type a number and then press `[enter]` in order to set it. To set the custom slideshow's name, it also does not save unless you press `[enter]`.

If you would like to save this slideshow, simply click the save button on the top right, and save a file of the proprietary `.nimwal` format. The file can then be loaded with the load button which can be located at the top left of the program.

# Wallpaper Presets
This program comes with a couple of wallpaper presets; `Rickroll` and `Bad Apple`.

To use these presets, simply use the dropdown and select one. Note, however, that these presets are predefined and cannot be modified.
